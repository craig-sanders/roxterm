Description: Multi-tabbed GTK+/VTE terminal emulator
 ROXTerm is a terminal emulator based on the VTE library. It was originally

 shifted to providing a richer range of features for power users.

 This package contains files used by both the GTK+2 (roxterm-gtk2) and 
 GTK+3 (roxterm-gtk3) versions.

 This is a virtual package to ease upgrade to roxterm-gtk3. Install
 roxterm-gtk2 instead if you want to stick with GTK+2.
