Description: Transitional package to upgrade roxterm-gtk3 to roxterm
 This is a dummy package to facilitate automatic upgrades from roxterm-gtk3 2.x
 to roxterm 3.x, due to a change in the packaging structure. It may be removed
 once the roxterm 3.x package is installed, but consider also explicitly
 installing roxterm to prevent its accidental removal by autoremove.

 pin an older version.
