Description: Multi-tabbed GTK/VTE terminal emulator
 ROXTerm is a terminal emulator based on the VTE library. It was originally
 intended to be a lightweight alternative to gnome-terminal, but its role has
 shifted to providing a richer range of features for power users. It can be used
 as a ROX application, as the name implies, but also integrates well with other
 X desktop environments such as GNOME.
