Prepararation
=============

First install the build dependencies, preferably after ensuring your system is
up-to-date. If your distribution already includes roxterm the command:

    apt-get build-dep roxterm

should suffice, but if their version is between 1.17.1 and 1.18.2 this may
install more packages than are now necessary. If you can't or don't want to
use build-dep, just continue; if debuild fails due to missing dependencies it
will say which packages are missing in its error message.

Additionally install the devscripts package, which includes debuild.

Use of git
----------

If using a clean git checkout you will also need autoconf, automake, autopoint,
libtool, autotools-dev, po4a, imagemagick, librsvg2-bin and the transifex client
(tx). If your distro does not include the transifex-client package install
python-setuptools and see
<http://help.transifex.net/user-guide/client/client-0.3.html>.

Once you have installed all the above run ./bootstrap.sh before proceeding.

Building the package
--------------------

The actual package build is automated by a script. In the directory unpacked by
the tarball or checked out by git, run:

    ./builddeb

This will build the package in a subdirectory called debtmp.

Alternatively, if using a release tarball, copy/rename/link the tarball to
roxterm_<version>.orig.tar.gz in the parent directory and run:
    
    debuild -uc -us

to create the package files in the parent directory.
